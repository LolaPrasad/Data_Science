    "The `logging` module and the `print` statement serve different purposes in Python, and choosing between them depends on the context and requirements of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences between `logging` and `print` statements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1.Output Destination:</b>\n",
    "   - `print`: Sends output to the standard output stream (usually the console).\n",
    "   - `logging`: Allows you to configure different output destinations, such as console, files, sockets, etc., through log handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2.Granularity of Information:</b>\n",
    "   - `print`: Typically used for simple debugging or quick output of values during development.\n",
    "   - `logging`: Provides a more sophisticated and configurable logging framework with different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to convey the severity of messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3.Configurability:</b>\n",
    "   - `print`: Lacks configurability. Once a `print` statement is added, it's challenging to control or disable it without modifying the code.\n",
    "   - `logging`: Offers extensive configurability. You can configure log levels, handlers, formatters, and filters globally or for specific loggers, providing fine-grained control over logging behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4.Severity Levels:</b>\n",
    "   - `print`: Does not provide built-in support for different severity levels. All output is treated equally.\n",
    "   - `logging`: Supports different severity levels, allowing you to categorize and filter messages based on their importance (e.g., DEBUG for debugging information, ERROR for critical issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5.Production Use:</b>\n",
    "   - `print`: Often used for quick debugging during development but is not suitable for production use.\n",
    "   - `logging`: Designed for production use. It allows you to capture and analyze log messages efficiently in a production environment without affecting the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to use `logging` over `print` in a real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Debugging and Development:</b>\n",
    "  - During development and debugging, `print` statements can be useful for quickly inspecting variable values or tracking program flow.\n",
    "  - However, for more systematic debugging and long-term maintenance, integrating logging with appropriate log levels provides a better approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Production Code:</b>\n",
    "  - In production code, using the `logging` module is highly recommended. It allows you to capture relevant information, categorize issues, and provide a detailed log of the application's behavior.\n",
    "  - `print` statements in production code are generally discouraged because they can clutter the output, may expose sensitive information, and are not easily controllable or configurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Severity Levels: </b>\n",
    "  - If you need to differentiate between different severity levels of messages (e.g., debugging information, warnings, errors), `logging` provides a clear structure through its log levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Configurability and Maintenance:</b>\n",
    "  - If you anticipate the need to configure or disable logging statements in different parts of your code without modifying the source, using `logging` with its configurability and modularity is more appropriate.\n"
